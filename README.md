# Real-Time Code Editor

## Introduction

The Real-Time Code Editor is a web-based code editor that allows multiple users to collaborate on code in real-time. This project is designed to facilitate collaborative coding sessions, code reviews, and pair programming without the need for complex setup or third-party tools.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit and view the same code in real-time, enabling seamless collaboration from different locations.

- **Syntax Highlighting:** The code editor provides syntax highlighting for various programming languages, making code easier to read and understand.

- **Code Sharing:** Easily share your code with others by generating a unique URL that grants access to the code editor with your code pre-loaded.

- **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in to access their saved code projects and track their contributions.

- **Version History:** The editor keeps track of code changes and allows users to revert to previous versions, making it easy to recover from mistakes.

- **Chat and Commenting:** Communicate with collaborators through an integrated chat or add comments to specific code sections.

- **File Management:** Organize your code projects with folders and files for efficient code organization.
